# The question

> What is commoditizing and de-commditization product in banking industry, in context of Vietnam?

So the systematic approach must be: **How is the value chain of banking industry now?**

Banking is about how people grow their own wealth, and experience their wealth.
With that, there are 2 dimensions in which we will mapping the customer persona.

- Wealth: the amount of non-liability assets that a person has amassed, which can be converted to cash without claimed by others.

- Income: the amount of wealth one can generated in an amount of time, compared to their wealth.

So basically there are 4 types of customer:

**1. High Wealth, High Income**: known as "money maker"

> They are master of using money/business to generate money, and has been there for a while, so what they need is an active money generation service, and extradionary lifestyle. Bluechip Security and Flexible bond options are their means. They don't want cashback, it discount their percepted networth, but demand high quality service (high credit limit, personal support).

**2. High Wealth, Low Income**: known as "golden spooner" or "money hoarder"

> Bank can serve them through passive money security such as cash deposit or fixed bond. They need an constant check at their assets, and favor all products that has money-saving opportunities (cashback)

**3. Low Wealth, High Income**: known as "hardcore entrepreneur"

> Bank can serve them through flexible lending options (credit line, household/mortgage). They percept that their wealth will be massive in the future, so too common product will damage that perception, but they don't need to premium product either. For them, time is gold. So fast, responsive, available service is utmost important when serving these people.

**4. Low Wealth, Low Income**: known as "common consumer"

> These people are price-senstitive for everything about money. They will seek out highest return rate / lowest loan rate on the table, without a glance at flexibility that comes with it. However, never make them feel cheap, because they are and they afraid that the world think of them as one. So the benefit list always has to be long, without significant expense from the bank, and price must the at the top. They search for money vehicle infrequently, so its easier to reach them through word of mouth or referral benefits. 

We will cover how to utilize more thoroughly these personas in the next part.
